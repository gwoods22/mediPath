The work being submitted by us is our own group work.

NOTE TO PROFS AND TA'S
JavaDoc folder contains the compiled JavaDoc website.

To get the website working you need to import the zip into the
Java EE perspective. If you don't already have this perspective,
you must Go to "Help" -> "Install New Software...". Then in the
new dialog, in the "Work with:" pull-down list, select
"Indigo - http://download.eclipse.org/releases/indigo",
but replace Indigo with your eclipse version. Then select the
following packages to install:
       "Web, XML, Java EE and OSGI Enterprise Development". 
       "Programming langauges -> Eclipse Java Development Tools"
After installation is complete, if you restart eclipse, you
should see an option for java perspective in
"window -> open perspective -> " or "window -> open perspective -> other"
You also need Tomcat for our site to work.
Now once in Java EE create a new "Dynamic Web Project" from the menu bar
and import the zip into this new Web project. Make sure to select the
the contents of the Group02_FinalProject folder not the root of the zip
or the root of the project to avoid import errors or you not being able
to run the code or server. When it imports properly, then click run as 
server in the run menu to start it up! Enjoy!
